# Image_Classification_System

# S – Situation

Image classification is a fundamental problem in computer vision, where an algorithm learns to categorize images into predefined classes. This technology is widely used in:

* Facial recognition (e.g., security systems).
* Medical imaging (e.g., detecting tumors in X-rays).
* Autonomous driving (e.g., identifying pedestrians, traffic signs).
The project aims to develop an image classification system using OpenCV and Matplotlib, processing images, extracting key features, and classifying them.

# T – Task

The primary objective of this project is to:

* Load and preprocess images (handling color spaces and resizing).
* Convert images to grayscale for feature extraction.
* Apply edge detection and other transformations to highlight critical patterns.
* Extract meaningful features from images for classification.
* Train a classification model using a dataset of labeled images.
* Evaluate the model's performance on test images.

# A – Action

The project consists of several key steps:

1. Data Loading & Preprocessing

* Used OpenCV (cv2) to load image data (cv2.imread()).
* Checked the image shape (img.shape) to understand its dimensions.
* Displayed images using Matplotlib (plt.imshow()) for verification.
* Converted images to grayscale using cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY), which helps in reducing complexity while preserving important features.

2. Feature Extraction

* Edge Detection: Applied techniques like:
* Canny Edge Detection (cv2.Canny()) to detect object boundaries.

Keypoint Detection:

* Used algorithms like SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) or ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) to identify important regions in the image.
* Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG): Extracted shape and texture features.
* Feature Visualization: Used Matplotlib to plot transformed images.

3. Model Training & Classification

* Created a training dataset by labeling images based on categories.
* Chose a classification model.
* Split the dataset into training and testing sets to ensure a fair evaluation.
* Trained the model and optimized it using accuracy metrics, precision, recall, and F1-score.

4. Testing & Model Evaluation

* Passed new images through the trained model.
* Evaluated performance using:
* Confusion Matrix to analyze correct vs. incorrect predictions.
* Classification Accuracy to measure overall performance.

# R – Result

* Successfully processed images and extracted key features.
* Built an image classification model that categorizes images accurately.
* Achieved high classification accuracy, proving the system's effectiveness.
* The model can be extended for real-world applications like:
  
1. Facial recognition in security systems.
2. Medical diagnosis using X-ray images.
3. Object recognition in self-driving cars.
